Using the CMIP6 database hosted on Amazon Web Services, choose any two models you like: use both their historical simulations and future projections from one of the four major SSPs (ssp126, ssp245, ssp370, or ssp585). **Provide a brief description of the models and scenarios you chose to include.**\n",

Access information from your chosen models and scenario, for any climate variable you like; however, note that three-dimensional data is generally larger and can be slower to load, so I recommend either choosing a two-dimensional data field or reading in only the surface level if you choose 3D information.
